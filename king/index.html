                <p style=" min-height:90px;text-align: center; padding-left: 1em;">Now, when he and I meet, after all these years,</p>
                <p style=" min-height:90px;text-align: center; padding-left: 1em;">I say to the bitch inside me, don’t start growling. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
                <p style=" min-height:90px;text-align: center; padding-left: 1em;">He isn’t a trespasser anymore,</p>
                <p style=" min-height:90px;text-align: center; padding-left: 1em;">Just an old acquaintance tipping his hat.</p>
                <p style=" min-height:90px;text-align: center; padding-left: 1em;">My voice says, “Nice to see you,”</p>
                <p style=" min-height:90px;text-align: center; padding-left: 1em;">As the bitch starts to bark hysterically.</p>
                <p style=" min-height:90px;text-align: center; padding-left: 1em;">He isn’t an enemy now,</p>
                <p style=" min-height:90px;text-align: center; padding-left: 1em;">Where are your manners, I say, as I say,</p>
                <p style=" min-height:90px;text-align: center; padding-left: 1em;">“How are the children? They must be growing up.” &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
                <p style=" min-height:90px;text-align: center; padding-left: 1em;">At a kind word from him, a look like the old days, &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
                <p style=" min-height:90px;text-align: center; padding-left: 1em;">The bitch changes her tone; she begins to whimper. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
                <p style=" min-height:90px;text-align: center; padding-left: 1em;">She wants to snuggle up to him, to cringe.</p>
                <p style=" min-height:90px;text-align: center; padding-left: 1em;">Down, girl! Keep your distance</p>
                <p style=" min-height:90px;text-align: center; padding-left: 1em;">Or I’ll give you a taste of the choke-chain.</p>
                <p style=" min-height:90px;text-align: center; padding-left: 1em;">“Fine, I’m just fine,” I tell him.</p>
                <p style=" min-height:90px;text-align: center; padding-left: 1em;">She slobbers and grovels.</p>
                <p style=" min-height:90px;text-align: center; padding-left: 1em;">After all, I am her mistress. She is basically loyal. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
                <p style=" min-height:90px;text-align: center; padding-left: 1em;">It’s just that she remembers how she came running &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
                <p style=" min-height:90px;text-align: center; padding-left: 1em;">Each evening, when she heard his step;</p>
                <p style=" min-height:90px;text-align: center; padding-left: 1em;">How she lay at his feet and looked up adoringly &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
                <p style=" min-height:90px;text-align: center; padding-left: 1em;">Though he was absorbed in his paper;</p>
                <p style=" min-height:90px;text-align: center; padding-left: 1em;">Or, bored with her devotion, ordered her to the kitchen &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
                <p style=" min-height:90px;text-align: center; padding-left: 1em;">Until he was ready to play.</p>
                <p style=" min-height:90px;text-align: center; padding-left: 1em;">But the small careless kindnesses</p>
                <p style=" min-height:90px;text-align: center; padding-left: 1em;">When he’d had a good day, or a couple of drinks,</p>
                <p style=" min-height:90px;text-align: center; padding-left: 1em;">Come back to her now, seem more important</p>
                <p style=" min-height:90px;text-align: center; padding-left: 1em;">Than the casual cruelties, the ultimate dismissal.</p>
                <p style=" min-height:90px;text-align: center; padding-left: 1em;">“It’s nice to know you are doing so well,” I say.</p>
                <p style=" min-height:90px;text-align: center; padding-left: 1em;">He couldn’t have taken you with him;</p>
                <p style=" min-height:90px;text-align: center; padding-left: 1em;">You were too demonstrative, too clumsy,</p>
                <p style=" min-height:90px;text-align: center; padding-left: 1em;">Not like the well-groomed pets of his new friends. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
                <p style=" min-height:90px;text-align: center; padding-left: 1em;">“Give my regards to your wife,” I say. You gag</p>
                <p style=" min-height:90px;text-align: center; padding-left: 1em;">As I drag you off by the scruff,</p>
                <p style=" min-height:90px;text-align: center; padding-left: 1em;">Saying, “Goodbye! Goodbye! Nice to have seen you again.”</p>

            <div class=" min-height: 50px;col-xs-5 portfolio-item">
                <p style="min-height:90px;">1 - The speaker and a man are reuniting after a long period of not talking to each other. The speaker makes it clear that their reunion was inevitable.</p>
                <p style="min-height:90px;">2 - The speaker refers to another voice inside her head as the bitch, a voice that is initially heavily upset at the man.</p>
                <p style="min-height:90px;">3 - She reassures herself and the bitch that she is no longer hurt by this man, although this isn't true seeing how the bitch reacts.</p>
                <p style="min-height:90px;">4 - This line furthers the allusion that she is pretending that she doesn't know this man, in this case by pretending he's a stranger.</p>
                <p style="min-height:90px;">5 - The speakers recognizes that she is in control. However, she is embarassed by the bitch and wants to keep her silent.</p>
                <p style="min-height:90px;">6 - The bitch is attempting to take control of the woman, but only causes her inner turmoil.</p>
                <p style="min-height:90px;">7 - When the woman talks directly to the bitch she is talking to herself in her mind. The woman is in control, but she is annoyed by the actions and responses of the bitch. She has to convince herself(the bitch) that remaining stoic is the best option.</p>
                <p style="min-height:90px;">8 - Manners are a socially created etiquette. In this scenario, speaking outwards or showing hurt towards a former lover is considered something only a bitch would do. Therefore, the inner woman is silenced.</p>
                <p style="min-height:90px;">9 - The children most likely refers the children the man had with another woman. Although this is not an uncommon question to ask, this could be a sign of the bitch influencing the woman. The bitch wants to know about the man and his life.</p>
                <p style="min-height:90px;">10 - The bitch begins here to remember the good parts of their past relationship.</p>
                <p style="min-height:90px;">11 - The author uses the word whimper here as a creative metaphor towards both a sad woman and a hurt dog.</p>
                <p style="min-height:90px;">12 - This line is interesting because the voice of the woman reprimands the bitch mid-sentence. Perhaps the woman feels as if even in narration she can sympathize with the bitch.</p>
                <p style="min-height:90px;">13 - She doesn't want herself to get close to the man, because she knows she will get hurt again. Furthermore, as with dogs, sometimes owners don't let their dogs near people to protect them. The author plays on both of these uses here. </p>
                <p style="min-height:90px;">14 - The choke chain when applied to dogs allows the owner to both silence and hold back the dog. In this case, the woman threatens to use the choke chain on the bitch. Meaning that she is going to suppress her inner emotions to the point where they no longer affect her attitude.</p>
                <p style="min-height:90px;">15 - This sentence is a comedic ploy towards the reader. After 14 lines of arguing with herself the speaker announces that she is fine. This is far from the truth, however, to say otherwise would be seen a 'bitch' thing to do.</p>
                <p style="min-height:90px;">16 - This line uses more dog like imagery to represent the inner emotions of the speaker. The bitch in this case is heavily infatuated with the past memories of the man. When dogs see something they like they slobber and grovel, now the inner woman is doing something similar.</p>
                <p style="min-height:90px;">17 - The line here confirms that the woman is in control, or at least mostly in control. The word 'basically' here implies that there are moments in which the bitch influences the woman. Also in this moment, the woman is becoming more sympathetic towards the bitch.</p>
                <p style="min-height:90px;">18 - The author uses the image here of a dog running towards its master. Loyal and tamed.</p>
                <p style="min-height:90px;">19 - The mere presence of the owner used to make the woman excited, everyday she felt this way.</p>
                <p style="min-height:90px;">20 - The next few lines show the dedication from the woman towards the man even in instances where he was not loyal to her.</p>
                <p style="min-height:90px;">21 - </p>
                <p style="min-height:90px;">22 - </p>
                <p style="min-height:90px;">23 - This can be attributed to people who work all day and then come home to play with their dog. Also the word 'play' here is important because it implies that their relationship was never always a mockery and never serious.</p>
                <p style="min-height:90px;">24 - This line implies their were very few good days of their relationship, and only under certain criteria.</p>
                <p style="min-height:90px;">25 - This might be a concept of how people tend to remember only the good parts of situations. The bitch here is only remembering the good parts of the relationship.</p>
                <p style="min-height:90px;">26 - </p>
                <p style="min-height:90px;">27 - The woman is not fooled however by the past memories. She is all too aware of the cruel breakup that she had with the man</p>
                <p style="min-height:90px;">28 - This line is intentionally written empty. The woman here is only saying things that have no real weight to them. The woman is trying her hardest to end the conversation as soon as possible while still being polite.</p>
                <p style="min-height:90px;">29 - The woman blames the bitch, her emotional side, for the man leaving her. She holds regrets towards the situation. Even though the man never paid attention to her in the relationship, she still blames herself.</p>
                <p style="min-height:90px;">30 - The woman equates herself as inferior to the man, and his new wife.</p>
                <p style="min-height:90px;">31 - The speaker quickly and efficiently ends the conversation. The bitch would never have a chance to speak or talk to the man.</p>
                <p style="min-height:90px;">32 - The tense of the bitch here turns to second person, as well on line 30. This might imply that the Woman is directly addressing the bitch, and is no longer a speaker in the poem. This showcases the internal struggle that the two have.</p>
                <p style="min-height:90px;">33 - A final symbolism towards the bitch actually being a dog. The scruff is the extra fur on a dog's neck.</p>
                <p style="min-height:90px;">34 - The poem ends sadly, there is no resolution for the woman or the bitch. Both characters end up unfulfilled and still at battle with each other. </p>
